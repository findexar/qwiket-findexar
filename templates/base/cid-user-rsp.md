lear# Monetize Your Sports Content with Qwiket's Revenue-Sharing Program

## Turn Your Audience into Substantial Income

Are you a sports or fantasy sports content creator looking to earn from your expertise? Qwiket's Revenue-Sharing Program (RSP) offers you a straightforward way to monetize your existing audience. Here's how you can start earning:

### How It Works: Simple Steps to Revenue

1. **Join the Program**: Once accepted, you'll receive a unique Affiliate ID (AID).
2. **Start with 200 Credits**: We'll kickstart your account with 200 credits for Qwiket AI use.
3. **Share Your Links**: Use your personalized links (with your AID) when sharing Qwiket content. The visitors from your links will be started with 100 free credits, which is 400% over the default user.
4. **Get Credits for Traffic**: For every 100 visitors through your links, we'll top up your Qwiket AI credits to 2000.
5. **Earn from Subscriptions**: When your readers become Qwiket subscribers, you earn 5% of their subscription fee. That's $1 per month for every $20 subscription.

### The Power of Recurring Revenue

Imagine converting 1000 of your readers into Qwiket subscribers. That's $1000 in your pocket every month, or $12,000 per year - without any additional effort! And remember, this is recurring revenue that keeps coming as long as those subscribers stay active.
